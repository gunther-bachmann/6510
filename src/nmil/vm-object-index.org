  may have multiple groups
  the file name is used for creating the racket require line
  the define (following) is used for racket require line
  the @DC-FUN line is used for the org-link
  the line following this @DC-FUN comment must:
  - have 1..n comments (describing the function)
  - have a single "define <some-label>" (which must include the fun-label in its body)
- @DC-ZP :: zero page annotation
  @DC-ZP: <zero-page-constant>(, group: <zp-group>(-<zp-group>)*)*
  example: ;; @DC-ZP: ZP_RA, group: registers-array
  the file name is used for creating the racket require line
  the enclosing define is used for racket require line
  the @DC-ZP line is used for the org-link
  the line following this @DC-ZP comment must:
  - have a single (byte-const <zero-page-constant>) followed by a describing comment
  - or have a single (word-const <zero-page-constant>) followed by a describing comment
- @DC-C :: constant
  @DC-C: <constant-label>(, group: <c-group>(-<cgroup>)*)*
  example: ;; @DC-C: TAG_BYTE_BYTE_CELL
  the file name is used for creating the racket require line
  the enclosing define is used for racket require line
  the @DC-C line is used for the org-link
  the line following this @DC-C comment must:
  - have a single (byte-const <zero-page-constant>) followed by a describing comment
  - or have a single (word-const <zero-page-constant>) followed by a describing comment
- @DC-M :: memory (locations)
  @DC-M: <mem-label>(, group: <m-group>(-<m-group)*)*
  example: ;; @DC-M: GLOBAL_CELLPAIR_PAGE_FOR_ALLOC, group: gc
  the file name is used for creating the racket require line
  the enclosing define is used for racket require line, must start with an org (<- allows for actual location derivation)
  the @DC-M line is used for the org-link
  the line following this @DC-M comment must:
  - be a line (label <mem-label>) with comments followed by
  - a single (byte ..) or (word ..) constant with comments
- @DC-B :: byte code
  @DC-B: <bc-label>(, group: <b-group>(-<b-group>)*)
  example: ;; @DC-B: BINC, group: byt
           ;; @DC-B: GET_AF_0, group: cell_array
  the file name is used for creating the racket require line
  the following define is used for racket require line and to extract the actual byte code
  the next define (starting with BC_) is used for assembler include
  the @DC-B line is used for the org-link
  the line following this @DC-B comment must:
