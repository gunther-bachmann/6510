/tooling to work with 6510 / c64 assembler code/

including a debugger, an interpreter and functions to write vice compatible executables

* ideas
** c64 lisp editor
- is written in mil! => extend mil such that this editor can be written
  - including efficient string manipulation (rope algorithms)
  - efficient mapping source-code (text) -> screen
  - efficient search and s/r algorithms
- use 40 character display to the best
  - combine the following
    ((, )), (), )( :: can be combined into one character
    single parenthesis (, are right aligned
    single parenthesis ), are left aligned
    ) followed by space can be combined to left aligned )
    space followed by ( can be combined to right aligned (
  - use short names (e.g. ~def~ for definitions)
  - allow for contextual short names
    import with rename
    contextual prefixes (with-prefix ...) or (w/p ...)
  - (just) vertical splitting of buffers (maybe even graphics), use /raster zeilen interrupt/ to switch
  - use sprites for contextual overlay or emphasis in text buffer
    - e.g. use colored sprite to mark matching braces
  - use sprite for cursor bar (to allow inter parenthesis positioning)
- make it emacs lispy
- make it the only interface to the system
- output goes into other buffer
- allow for quick buffer switches
- keep buffers in memory pages (extension)
- each displayed line holds a pointer to the actual textline hold in memory
