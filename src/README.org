/6510 assembler and tools to write, debug, execute assembler targeted at the c64/

The assembly is transformed in several steps
1. Translate orignal 6510 assembler using a parser to scheme syntax (see file:asm)
2. Macro expand scheme syntax to ast command structure (see file:scheme-asm)
3. Resolve ast commands that contain references that cannot be resolved right away  (INCOMPLETE)
   1. resolve decision based labels (local labels and required from other modules)
   2. resolve local labels
   3. resolve local constants
   4. resolve lables required from other modules (files)
   5. resolve constants required from other modules (files)
4. Write bytes (INCOMPLETE)
