/utility functions to define scheme-asm functions/

Scheme asm is the assembler code using scheme syntax.
e.g.
#+begin_src racket
  (LDA "!$20")    ;; LDA #$20
  (label "some")  ;; some:
  (BNE "some")    ;; BNE some
#+end_src

This syntax is used in [[file:../example/6510-example-rs.rkt]]

The assembler commands in scheme syntax are actually syntax macros that are rewritten to ast commands as defined in
[[file:../ast/6510-command.rkt]].
