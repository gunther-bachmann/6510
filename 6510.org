#+title: 6510 Racket Experiments
* racket: scheme (lisp) with facilities to create dsls
* 6510: processor in my beloved c64
* running example
  #+begin_src racket :lang racket
       (LDA "#$41")
       (JSR ":outchar")
       (ADC "#1")
       (JSR ":outchar")
       (RTS)

    (LABEL ":outchar")
       (JSR "$FFFF")
       (RTS)
  #+end_src
* TODO different phases during program evaluation (elaborate)
* syntax macros carrying location etc.
  - show examples of syntax objects
* composable syntax definition (via megaparsack, based on haskell megaparsec)
  - get information on composable parsers
* parse arbitrary syntax via megaparsack into racket ast, then use racket syntax transformations
* usual workflow
  - use racket to write your dsl most closely to what you expect it to look like
  - in a last an final step, transform syntax to that representation
