#+title: TODO
list of todo items, prioritized and elaborated
goal: have precise stories to work on and complete
* Descriptions
** MIL Runtime
create a set of functions (6510 code) that will allow a MIL Interpreter (or compiled MIL code) to execute this includes
implement minimal set first
*** Memory Managment
- garbage collection/or explicit allocation/deallocation
- memory layout
- allocation/deallocation/collection of basic data structures
*** basic data structures + operations
- *byte*
- int
- *char* (is a byte?)
- *string* (is an array of char?)
- float
- *cells* (cons-cells)
- *lists*
- arrays
- maps
*** input/output
- write data (basic data structures) to *screen*, tape, disc, printer ??
- read data (basic data structure ) from *keyboard*, tape, disc ??
** Virtual Machine
implement a stack machine with byte code to execute basic MIL functions
First implementation will be a simple interpreter loop [fetchen, decode, execute]
*** instructions
e.g.
- push basic data
- call runtime function (MIL Runtime is in place)
- call user function
*** calling conventions (call frames)
*** resolving names
- user names
- runtime names
- scoping
* Research
see [[file:~/mil.readlist.org::*literature][literature]]
** movable memory (=> additional indirection on access)
using a memory extension that can page in a memory page at some address (in some range) could be used without code adjustments, if the
access to memory would be redirected from virtual page -> actual address.  this indirect access could be utilized for certain accesses.  it
would be nice if this access still allows for quick access if the access is repeatedly done (e.g. jit to replace indirect access w/ direct
access, while undoing this, once the page is swapped out again).  this indirect access is optional and does not incur runtime penalties for
direct access!
** requirements of continuation on call-frame, resolving names, garbage collection, memory ownership
** look at other intermediate compiler languages of functional languages
- e.g. guile scheme (https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Guile-Implementation.html)
- macscheme https://web.archive.org/web/20101210181945/http://larceny.ccs.neu.edu/doc/larceny-notes.html

* Epic
** OBSOLETE allocate/deallocate page (type)
(obsolete since this will be implemented with the mil vm interpreter)
- allocate a page of a certain type (e.g. *stack-page*, *code*, *byte/char-array*, *cell-pair/list-page*, *cell page*, float page, int page)
- keep a free-list / used-list (per type)
- free a page
- allow introspection of pages
- define layout and access to page types
** output a string
e.g. ~(displayln "hello world")~
*** stories
**** vm-interpreter
***** memory manage strings
- bootstrap code (program startup)
- constant strings / array of char => byte/char-array-page
***** code as list of vm-instructions
- give translation of (display "some string") in vm instructions
***** runtime method to write string to the screen
***** fetch, decode, execute
- for all vm instructions necessary to do hello word
