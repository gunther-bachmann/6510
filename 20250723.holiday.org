** IMPLEMENT what part of the 6510 vm design should be implement w/ racket to validate design?
implement all necessary to do a reverse function tail called implementation with space optimized byte code
see [[file:src/nmil/svm-compiler.rkt::(m-fun-def (reverse (a-list cell*) (b-list cell* '()) -> cell*][test with reverse function]]
this will include the implementation of
- [X] function call
- [X] function selection (index vs. ptr to actual function), first impl use ptr (low bits indicate direct ptr / index)
  - [X] currently only selection through direct pointers
- [X] call frame construction
- [X] parameter passing
- [X] local vars
- [X] tail call recursion
- [X] returning from a call
- [X] optimization idea: no parameter ptr, just cell-stack
  - example reverse list
    (def (reverse (a-list cell*) (b-list cell* '()))
      "reverse the a-list into b-list"
       (if (nil? a-list)
           b-list
           (reverse (cdr a-list) (cons (car a-list) b-list)))

    push fast local #0     ;; a-list new-b-list
    cdr                    ;; new-a-list new-b-list
    tail-call
  - inline code

      bra loop
    done:
      pop               ;; new-b-list
  - other parameter order

    push a-list
    push nil
    call reverse

    ;; push nil ;; <- entry if default is not set
                           ;; resulting stack

  - [X] implement refcount gc for tree functions (having pointers in both cells)
- [X] implement basic byte code debugger on top of 6510 debugger
  - [X] single step
  - [X] run to next call/return
  - [X] step over call
** TODO write new tests for call-stack to verify local allocation/free on same page and over pages
** IMPLEMENT implement prime sieve (using native array)
- [X] prime sieve with cell-array
- [ ] prime sieve with native array (byte indicator)
- [ ] prime sieve with native array (bit indicator)
** IMPLEMENT implement some code for native arrays (strings)
- native-array/string functions
  - write to @/read from @
  - copy subarray (substring)
  - concatenate/append arrays
  - to-list / from-list
** refcount qualities
- provide function w/ ref and w/o ref counting <- for optimization
  - name-convention: function w/ ref counting: ...​_RZ
- optimize check for ref-count applicable | atomic value
  cell-stack and RT may only hold
  - xxxxxxx0 -> ptr to cell or more complex structure, could be pointer to a cell-page, or a m1-page
  - xxxxxx01 -> cell pair ptr
  - 0xxxxx11 -> atomic int
  - 11111111 -> atomic byte
  => ptr check here can be done by: and $03; cmp $03; bne is-a-ptr; rts;
     alternatively: lsr; bcc is-ptr; lsr; bcc is-pair-ptr; rts; <- benefit, a is index to refcount byte
     or a combination of the two
  heap cells may also be:
  - 10000111 -> cell array + more
  - 10001111 -> native array + more
- provide additional info for ref counting (e.g. knowledge about the data)
** enable easy byte code modification
the byte code and its usage should be implemented flexible enough to make adjustments that either provide space or speed benefits (or even
both)
- combine cmds :: create one byte code for two one byte commands
- prefix :: make less common one byte command a two byte (prefixed) command
- remove prefix :: make more common two byte (prefixed) command a single byte command
- combine cmd op :: combine common byte operand combinations into a 'fast' single byte command
- decombine :: undo a combined command
** IMPLEMENT optimize byte code
- push_​local_​0, write_​to_​local_​0 :: make this a one byte command (not a short instruction) => speeds up decoding
- [X] cadr cdar caar cddr :: could be put into a fast instruction
- cxyzr :: 2 byte instruction, where the second byte is encoded to do
  lldddddd : ll = 0..3 => 3..6 times apply car/cdr depending on bit d at position 0..5
             d = 1 = cdr, d = 0 = car.
- [X] true?-ret false?-ret :: combine true?-branch ret, false?-branch ret
- [X] coons :: two conses ?
- move inc_​int, max_​int into single byte opcodes
- [X] push_​local_​n_​car, push_​local_​n_​cdr :: push and car or cdr
- nil?_​branch, not_​nil?_​branch :: branch on (not) nil
- int_​0_​branch, not_​int_​0_​branch :: branch on (not) int = 0
- int_​1_​branch, not_​int_​1_​branch :: branch on (not) int = 1
- byte_​0_​branch, not_​byte_​0_​branch :: branch on (not) byte = 0
- byte_​1_​branch, not_​byte_​1_​branch :: branch on (not) byte = 1
- string_​empty_​branch, not_​string_​empty_​branch :: branch on (not) string empty
- pop + push :: can be done by a write
- call + ret :: can be combined to a jump
  iff enough locals are available (in current function)
  careful! function pointer must be adjusted (for tail calls of the called function)
** IMPLEMENT enhance debugger
- [X] pretty print the next x byte code instructions
- [X] make inspection routines fail safe (ignore exceptions)
- [X] switch from/to bc/assembler debugger
- [X] send command to surface interactor
- [X] use colors to separate prompt, output, disassembly
- [X] allow setting breakpoints on bytecode (at a certain address)
- [X] allow in place execution of bytecode
- [X] going back bc steps
- [ ] print (shortened) call stack (w/ function names) [ function-name : pc : #locals ]
- [ ] add watch on memory <- continuous output of this value after each step
- [ ] add watch on variable <- implementation could be a trace point (like a breakpoint, but not stopping)
- [ ] add page view (continuous update) during execution
- [ ] add breakpoint on memory change
- [ ] add stack view (continuous update)
- [ ] add call-frame view (continuous update)
- [X] inspection of vm variables (zp_​vm_​pc, zp_...)
- [ ] inspect/manipulate call frame
- [ ] inspect/manipulate value stack
- [-] inspect/manipulate memory - cells/lists/structures/strings/native arrays/arrays
  - [X] cells

  - [ ] arrays
** how much of the 6510 code should be actually written and tested with the interpreter (and actually used to interpret byte code)?
** design persisted byte code (constants, unlinked symbols, bytecode), linker/loader
** generate persisted byte code (single module, multi module in mind)
** implement loader/linker
** IMPLEMENT glue together mil + vm + loader and linker
- (m-def ...) -> vm, execute, debug?
- see [[file:src/cisc-vm/mil-svm-generator.rkt]]
** glue together mil + 6510 vm
** IDEA runtime profiling                    -> evaluate optimizations

- assembly code
  - run
    - number/duration of calls of a method/label
    - number of accesses on zp_ variables
    - number of indirect accesses through zp_ variables
    - number of accesses on vm_ variables (e.g. memory map etc)

    - stack sizes over time
  - gc
    - number of cell/cell-pair/cell-array/native-array alloc, free, reclaim, etc.
    - pages (type, #free cells ...) over time

** IDEA implement larger array by using a BST tree of arrays?
** IDEA change table with dispatch addresses (for certain programs? might optimize memory footprint)
** IDEA collect statistics for
- common two byte combinations <- byte code combinations
  - e.g. combine these into one byte commands
- number of usages of single byte codes
  - e.g. move less common to prefixed-commands, ...
** IDEA for native code implementation of (parts of) functions
(have a rough idea of how this could be done, don't actually implement)
- replace byte code sequence with byte-code indicating switchover to native code
  then use sequences of JSR that circumvent the decoding steps
  leaving native code and going back to byte code is done by calling the interpreter loop again
- calling functions that have been replaced by native code (hot swap)
  need indirection (no direct pointer for call, rather index)
  need for data structure for mapping index to ptr
** IDEA reduce ref counting for locals
did some experiments on branch ~optimize_rev_app_w_extra_bc~
- PULL​_FROM​_LOCAL​_n <- remove the value pulled from the local store => no ref needed counting!
- sequences of getting a ptr from locals, incrementing ref count, the doing car/cdr, decrementing pointer + incrementing new one
  can be compacted to only incrementing the final retrieved value
- incrementing ref count and then doing a destructive NIL? etc. is not necessary either
  example:
  #+begin_src scheme
    (bc WRITE_TO_L1)   ;; increment ref count
    (bc NIL?)               ;; replace tos with boolean result => decrement ref count
  #+end_src
- further analyse locals usage and how to reduce number of refcount changes in functions
- ref counts are important if calling a sub routine <- do refcounting then (and keep that info)
- leaving a function that has locals
  - it has called a subfunction => locals were refcounted => upon leaving, decrement refcounts (without deallocation!)
** IDEA do tracing only on call and ret
- print function names, too
- print stack on call and result on ret
** IDEA profiling (on jsr/rts) e.g. via tracing point
- use information of labels to convert addresses -> labels
- collect cycles spent
- collect number of calls
** IDEA functions allow for metadata (could enhance tracing) and defaults
(e.g. byte 0 includes flag for existence, absence of metadata, number of defaults and number of locals)
MDDDLLLL  M : flag for metadata existence
          DDD : 0..7 default values (or just 0..3)
          LLLL: 0..15 locals        (or just 0..7)

Metadata existence means: there is an additional cell, pointing to the function string (even aligned, readonly native array)
offset   content
----------------
-2(n+1)  [cell-ptr -> native array with function string name]   <-- even aligend (so that cell-ptr is detected as such)
-2n      [cell default n]
         ...
-2       [cell default 1]
0        [MDDDLLLL] (byte)
         [Function BC 0]
         ...
         [Function BC x]
         ? possible one padding byte
?        [native array function name]                           <-- even aligned ? (really, is there a need for that), or should this be alloced during loading and linking)
?        [other default values, the default cells are pointing to (e.g. a structure)]

** IDEA call with defaults (related to concept of constants!)
- special call instruction
  - call​_with​_1​_default ... n​_defaults
  - defaults are cells before the byte defining the # of locals
  - defaults are read only
  - defaults (since cells) must be allocated on even addresses (bit 0=0)
  - the call instruction pushes these defaults automatically in the stack before executing the function
  - the defaults are organized reverse =>
    if function accepts two defaults
      and is called with the first default explicitly set by the caller
      and call​_with​_1​_default is used
    => only the second default is pushed on the stack
** IDEA instruction cache (see python caching) (see https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/InternalDocs/interpreter.md#Specialization and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGZPSWZSkJI&t=1470s)
- use specialized byte code instruction (with guard to fall back to more general byte code)
- fallback/specialization rewrites bytecode
- right behind bytecode some information is 'cached'
  - fallback/specialization counts
- byte code that can be specialized is organized in 'families' that define how much extra bytes are needed
- special byte code execution should be much faster than general byte code execution
  (e.g. int-add vs. finding the right add and then use conversions + float-add?)
** IDEA restrict function names to one case and only some special chars => function meta data as name is compact
- store 3 characters in 2 bytes (each 5 bit)
- A-Z (26) or a-z
- _-?>< and byte 0 to mark end?
- drawbacks: no numbers, no lower/upper case characters <- worth it?
  probably not! get rid of metadata if possible (e.g. through static linking?)
** IDEA make compilation phases more explicit
- macro decomposition into an ast (this ast is worked on/rewritten during the different phases)
- transformation from ast/stack orientation -> register oriented atomic commands
- vm-register allocation + reordering sub expressions (optimization)
  - function parameters can be evaluated in any order (strict eval scheme)
- optional: others like constant folding
** IDEA information collected/used during compilation phases
Maybe add this information as a hashmap, allowing for arbitrary information to be added any time
What information is needed for the different phases? => check the different optimization problems, collect necessary information
- precode :: used to store atomic expressions that need to run before the code for the current node can be executed
  e.g. ~(byte+ a 1)~ needs a precode instruction to load the constant 1 into a local reg such that the byte+ instruction has only references left, that can be passed to the call
- is-recursive-call :: is the given node a recursive call? (must be a ast-e-fun-call)
- parameter-id-map :: parameter id to parameter register map (to resolve parameter references), does not change w/i function
- locals-id-map :: mapping locally introduced ids to local registers, does change, whenever a new local is introduced
- globals-id-map :: mapping global ids to global registers, is setup once
- registers-usage :: description of the register use and liveliness (e.g. vm_​l0 r/w, vm_​p1 r)
  this information (of the dataflow) is used for instruction reordering
  it can be used to find out which register are free (not live anymore) for allocation for other instructions
- negated :: (on if nodes), is the given nodes' bool expression negated? => code generation needs to take this into account, may happen if else/then branches are swapped
- source code location :: location of the original source
- previous node :: reference to node before change (to track changes through compilation)
- previous note :: note that describes the transformation done from previous node to current node

* byte code
** ideas
*** reduce code size in memory by using special byte code for calls
- [ ] how much potential is there (for the added complexity)?
- e.g. byte code ranges reserved for hot functions (which are then called by one byte, saving two bytes)
- dynamically register byte code -> function mapping (that may change during program execution)
*** provide easy ROM Routine access
- [ ] rom calling conventions and which registers are used for parameter passing
- e.g.: ROM : execute a call to ROM (fill A with Byte from stack)
  could be implemented as short command (-,  A,  AX, AY, AXY, XY, X,  Y)
                                         000 001 011 101 111  110 010 100
  put result on the stack (as bytes) <- how do I know which to store
  store carry, for later branch (if necessary)
- alternative coding: 4 byte code
  byte
  1 - ROM byte code
  2 - flags for source/target/carry register copy
      IN   OUT
      0000 0000
      |||+- accumulator is copied (byte value)
      ||+-- x
      |+--- Y
      +---- carry bit (is boolean value)
  3 - lowbyte call target
  4 - highbyte call target
*** DONE remove short commands, use regular commands that jump to routine
which uses the lower bits as arguments/operand
this allows for the removal of short command logic
** decisions to be made
- what byte codes are extended byte codes
- +what byte codes are short byte code (including operand)+
- what byte codes are minimal (able to emulate all others)
- how do I move a given byte code + implementation + disassembler etc. to a different category
- collect bc available for categories
  - [R]B (1 byte) regular byte code:    *127*
    short encoding, used for often used commands
  - +[S]B (1 byte) short byte code:      *16*, *8* possible operands each+
    short encoding of commands with limited number of operands or variations
    - with operand: try to reuse bit pattern of byte code for operand encoding/decoding <- preferred use of short encoding
    - w/o operand: use bit pattern of byte code for function selection <- it is preferred to use regular byte code for this
  - [E]B (2 bytes) extendend byte code: *254*
    - uncommon commands
  - [X]B optional: (3 bytes) byte code: *254*
    - rare commands (if ever)

** more elaborate data structures
- OPTIONAL tree for ordered traversal/find (each node needs data to decide <=, >)
  useful for set implementation, sorted/ordered dynamic growing/shrinking data structure.
  useful for implementation of editor metadata for each line (with int = linenumber, value=line-string), but maybe n-ary tree is better suited
  useful for implementation and validation reference counting algorithm for byte code commands, stack, locals, register and heap usage!
  could be implemented as persistent data structure (rewriting parents to the root on changes)
  first implementation with overwriting through addition byte codes set-car, set-cdr operations (gc-ing overwritten pointers)
      invariant: all values of left-subtree ov level-a node A are < value of the level-a node!
                 level-a nodes do not hold value payloads (only compare values/hashes)
                 level-b nodes hold references to level-a nodes or values!
                 level-b nodes must hold either a value or a ref in car position (never NIL), cdr may be NIL (or a value or reference).
      there are level a and level b nodes. level a nodes are for holding values in car position,
      level b nodes are the actual binary tree structure
      level a nodes have the (actual) sub tree (level b) in cdr and the max left subtree value in car position
        binary tree:   o        ---- level_0
                      /
                     1
        maps to: (l_0a c1 . (l_0b 1 . NIL))
        (these binary trees do not always map to lists, since they may hold values in cdr position)

  - tree construction/update
    - (make-la level-b-sub-tree) => (cValue . B-SubTree)
      get max value of left subtree of the given b-sub-tree as cValue
    - (add level-a-root value)
      traverse tree to find right spot where to add the new value
    - (remove level-a-root value)
      travers tree to find value and remove it from the tree
     travers to node with value, returning keeping tree trail to it
      (fn (tree-trail-to la-node val (trail '()))
        (cond [(<= val (car node)) ;; search left sub tree
               (tree-left-trail-to (cdr node) value (cons node trail))]

     to make it tail recursive, move code from tree-left/right-... to tree-trail!
  - tree traversal
- b-tree (persistent) <- keep somewhat balanced? balancing tree will enlarge undo/redo buffer usage!
  - eval b-tree compared to n-ary tree for source code (line) meta data (or multiple lines on one leaf?)
  - avl tree ? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)
  - read-black tree maybe, to keep it somewhat balanced ?
    how to keep the color on a car/cdr node? (could be kept in the reference count byte e.g. bit 7)
    tree may contain pointer to other tree nodes (cons pairs) or native arrays (leading spaces, total len, character data). no payload bit is free.
    red,black nodes may be used from different page sets. => there is a function to determine whether a cons pair comes from a "red" (or a "black") page => changing color = moving cons cell to other page?
- n-ary tree (non-persistent)
- n-ary tree (of editor strings)
  node: car = (ptr = level-down | value)
        cdr = ptr to sibling | NIL <- n-arry tree allows for n siblings (same level)
  - (make-node val) -> node
      creates a list: (list val)
  - (add-sibling node val) -> node
      extends list (node) by inserting (list val) as last element of the list <- cannot be put at the head, because tree structure would be lost
  - (first-child node) -> node
      is car (with result being a ptr, otherwise it has no children!)
  - (next-sibling node) -> node
      is cdr
  - (data node) -> val
      is car (with result being no ptr, otherwise it would have children!)
  - necessary lisp functions: car, cdr, cons, append <- append can be simplified in case of binary trees!
      (def (append (a list) (b list) list)
           (reverse (reverse a) b))
** keep meta information (related to debugging)
- source code location
- default values
- types
- name -> index
** implement text editor (mostly) in mil
  Data structures for a text editor:

  gap buffer:
  - keep text two separate portions of memory, copying between them.
  - cursor is at the end of the left buffer, inserting = adding to first buffer
  - second buffer is the text behind the cursor
  - moving cursor = copying first buffer <-> second buffer (can be delayed until insertion is done)

  - gap buffer implementation using a list of pages before cursor, list of pages after cursor
    (head of gap_pre_buffers is page with cursor) lines + text before cursor
    (head of gap_post_buffers is page right after cursor) <- text + lines after cursor

  - IDEA: no gap buffer, use screen data only, storing lines into memory when scrolling out of visibility?
          => there cannot be invisible data (scrolled out left and right)? => need for line break
             alternative: left|right invisible chars need to be saved/rendered efficiently <- is this really possible / not overly complex?
          ADVANTAGE: no dual changes (memory model + render)
          PROBLEM: undo/redo?

  - IDEA: gap buffer modification
          put current edit line (when actually editing, not if moving)
              into one extra page (text before cursor at start of page, text behind cursor, end of page),
              text is plain, without any encoding (like leading spaces or length data)
              cursor = ptr in page, typing = inserting text at cursor position
                                    erasing = deleting text before cursor position
              [<text before cursor>| ........  <text behind cursor>]
                                   /\        /\
                  pointer to cursor            pointer to text behind cursor
          once editing a line is done, it is copied into the regular text buffers
          format: [len][#leading-spaces]characters[len][0],
                  with len = total length of this line (including leading spaces) [stored two times, to do fast scanning|moving
                       #leading-spaces = number of spaces before first char starts
                       characters = actual text
                       0 = zero, marking end of line (for scanning)
                  lines are always kept completely on one page!

  - IDEA: keep current line# up to date <- needs to be updated with insertions / deletions
  - IDEA: keep line anchors (limited number of pointers to strings with their line number) <- need to be updated once lines are inserted (or invalidated)
  - IDEA: keep line anchors for all visible lines

    fast implementation:
    - render-line 'a starting from column 'b [to column 'c] at visual line 'd (two variants: 1. for currently edited line, 2. regular encoded text line)
    - scroll up/down 'n lines
    - scroll left/right 'n columns

    - insert/delete char
    - insert/delete line
    - insert/delete block
    - undo/redo (keep modifications + undo data)

  - multiple cursors (are not supported for fast operation)

  - IDEA: use mil data structures to implement the above
          => native array for currently edited line <- indexed access + copy left<->right from cursor
             tree of strings for current buffer text
             path to current line (for moving cursor line-wise through the text) = search previous/next leaf based on current node-path
             (e.g. line of a buffer = cell-pair (car = int, leading spaces + strlen, cdr = pointer to native string/array))
             buffer = n-ary tree of lines <- binary tree has advantage of using car/cdr pair only <- start out with this
             (rebalance tree once in a while)
             undo/redo = persistent tree data structure?, undo/redo organized in n-ary tree itself.
             <- when to discard? (running low on memory, discard most distant (tree distance) nodes)
                siblings are ordered last touched first
** IMPLEMENT debugging
- [X] level 0: debug 6510 code
- [X] level 1: debug vm code (byte code), trace, inspect, step-debugger, memory inspector
- [ ] level 2: debug mil, function/expression entry, inspect parameters, locals, etc, call stack, memory inspector
** implement vm in mil
- precondition: all language features are implemented, debugging should be possible
- information gained: optimize execution speed + bytecode size + heap usage + c64 implementability
** memory management
- basic idea: don't do ref counting within a function
  - do reference counting only upon returning from a function
  - try to allocate/discard locally
- idea: memory pages
  each page is used to allocate a certain type
  - [X] list page (car/cdr cell-pairs)
  - [X] array<> page (uniform type arrays)
  - [X] structure page (page storing structures)
  - dynamicArray<> page (arrays of polymorphic types)
  - hashmap page (table for hashmaps)
  - float page (page for float numbers)
  - byte-code page
  - native-code page
- sketch a memory usage upon function enter / leave (and during execution) to find a way to achieve this goal
- atomic values (char, byte, int) are copied (to-from locals) without reference counting, except when used to create a list?
- lists and arrays/strings are allocated on the heap and need to ref-count the cells
- describe each instruction more closely to check how we can avoid reference counting
- maybe start with explicit memory management (alloc, free)

** open tasks
*** IMPLEMENT implement RP as (secondary) register for cell pairs
- OBSOLETE: RP dec-refctn and inc-refcnt can safely assume that rp holds either 0, nil or a reference to a cell-pair?
  not really, dereferencing RP cell0-> RP could make RP hold e.g. int 0000 and no other cell pair ptr
*** TODO split vm-interpreter in groups of interpreted bc commands
*** TODO implement RP usage as TOS-1 register on demand
+ do this for operations in need of 2+ operands (which then discard the operands and just leave the result on the stack)
+ implement INT*, INT+, INT-, INT/ with this mechanism
+ e.g. POP_TOSM1_TO_RP, WRITE_TOSM1_TO_RP?, or WRITE_LOCAL_N_TO_RP
+ then execute binary operation and discard RP (and ensure that reference counting for RP can be ignored)
=> if both operands are on the stack, then POP_TOSM1_TO_RP before executing the operation
   if one operand is on the stack, the other can be written directly to RP
   if the result keeps references to cells referenced through RP, it might be necessary to inc-refcnt them <- who does that
- identify all binary operations that may benefit from this mechanism
  operand operation operand -> result : most benefit if operands and result don't need refcnt'ing
  - mult, add, sub, div, mod, shift-right, shift-left, ... (byte/int)
*** TODO unify function naming (mostly done)           -> clean code
*** TODO ensure test coverage                          -> ensure functionality over changes
- define use cases
- is there a way to automate test-coverage stats (e.g. branch coverage, command coverage)?
  - generate list of addresses (for line coverage) + indicator executed
  - generate list of addresses w/ branches + indicator taken/not-taken
- define tests
  - all tests must have a text describing the test
  - all tests should be resilient to memory location changes of registers etc.
- use most recent test utils
*** TODO check: do pointers on cells exist that are on the locals/eval-stack?
- currently the answer is *NO*, does that restrict the programming model?
*** TODO tweak configuration parameters                -> increase speed/reduce memory consumption
use profiling data

*** cell types and references
cell types fall into 3 categories
**** cell pointer
tag byte ends on bits 0 [cell-ptr], or 01 [cell-pair-ptr]
points somewhere.
- it points to another cell (points to either a cell pointer, a value cell or a header cell)
- it points to a cell-pair
**** value cell
a value cell holds its (complete) value
- int, tag byte  = 0... ..11 (& $83 = $03)
- byte, tag byte = 1111 1111 ($FF)
**** header cell
is a cell that is used as a header of a number of cells. the following headers exist
- header for an *array of cells* (useful for structures)
  tag byte = 1000 0011 ($83)
  offset  content        <- memory layout
  ------------------
  00      header-cell
  01      length of array (n+1)
  02..03  cell index 0 *)
  04..05  cell index 1
  ...
  ..n*2+3 cell index n

  *) cells in an array of cells may be either cell-ptr or value cells, never header cells!!

- header fo a *native array of bytes* (useful for strings)
  tag byte = 1000 0111 ($87)

*** call frames
- a call frame is defined by the following variables (on the zero page)
  ZP_​​VM_​PC                    *  ptr to the current byte code
  ZP_​VM_​FUNC_​PTR              *  ptr to the current running function
  ZP_​​CELL​_​STACK​_​LB​_​PTR           ptr to the low byte of the cell stack (cell-eval-stack is spread over two pages) [the lb of this ptr itself is always 0]
  ZP_​CELL_​STACK_​HB_​PTR           ptr to the high byte of the cell stack [the lb of this ptr itself is always 0]
  ZP_​LOCALS_​LB_​PTR            *  ptr to the low bytes of the locals of the currently running function [lowbyte of the ptr itself is equal to the highbytes one]
  ZP_​LOCALS_​HB_​PTR            *  ptr to the high bytes of the locals of the currently running function [lowbyte of the ptr itself is equal to the lowbytes one]
  ZP_​CELL_​STACK_​TOP              index to the top element on the cell stack

  ZP_​CALL_​FRAME                  pointer to start of current call frame stack
  ZP_​CALL_​FRAME_​TOP_​MARK         index to byte behind current call frame stack (byte) (is stored into page at $02, when page is full)
- a stack frame pushed on to the stack can either be a slow/fast frame
- fast stack call frame (4b): allowed for calls w/o overflows (neither stack, nor local overflow nor function running over page boundary)

    |                  vm pc                  | <-- call-frame-ptr
    | func-ptr low-byte | locals-ptr low byte |   ;; locals-ptr low byte must be != $00/$01

    push: possible if - vm_​pc and func-ptr share the same page
                      - cell-stack does not overflow (has 16 entries reserve)
                      - locals do not overflow (has reserves to hold functions' need)
    pop: if (call-frame-tr + 3) != $00 (or $01), its a a fast frame
- slow stack call frame (10b): allowed for any call (including page overflows: stack, locals allocation or function running over page boundary)

    |                   vm pc                     | <-- call-frame-ptr
    |     (reserved)       | locals ptr shared lb |
    | locals-lb page       | locals-hb-page       |
    |  func-ptr  low       | $00 / $01            | func-ptr could be encoded into: lowbyte, highbyte =  vm_​pc page + $00/$01 (of byte 4 in this stack) <- would save two bytes of stack size

    NOTE: if func-ptr page would be copied into (reserved), additional encoding/decoding into last byte could be removed, saving code bytes and complexity
          reserved byte could be used for somthing else, though => remove later?
          last byte must be either $00 or $01 to identify frame type!

    NOTE:  | cell-stack-lb page   | cell-stack-hb-page   | (copying the cell stack should not be necessary, the resulting stack should be cleaned up by the called method, known the # of parameters to actually remove etc.)
           cell-stack-tos  (copying not necessayr!)

    push: all relevant data
    pop: if (call-frame-ptr + 9) == $00(or $01)), its a a slow frame
         in a slow frame, high byte of func-ptr is high byte of vm_​pc - byte at 9 (either 00 or 01)
*** function metadata (descriptors)
 function descriptor:
 ---- idea
         function name
         length of function name
         default cell d-1       default cells can only be value cells or NIL ptr
    ...
         default cell 0
 ---- implemented
    00 : mddd llll  (#of locals in lower 4 bits, # of default values, m flag, indicating presence of function metadata)
    01 : start of byte code  (defaults offset?)
    ...

*** locals
locals are organized as stack (page pair)
   00: page type           00: page type
   01: previous lb page    01: previous hb page
   02: top mark (filled when leaving this page)
   03: lowbyte cell 0      03: high byte cell 0
   ...

each cell can be either a cell pointer or a call value (never cell header)
*** cell stack (evaluation stack)
cell-stack is organized as stack (page pair)
   00: page type           00: page type
   01: previous lb page    01: previous hb page
   02: lowbyte cell 0      02: high byte cell 0
   ...

each cell can be either a cell pointer or a call value (never cell header)
** concepts with functions
- page :: os allocation unit
  - alloc, free, bitmap of available pages
- cell :: smallest data unit
  - alloc, refcount, free, free-list, cells-page, cell-page-list
- cell-pair :: pair of cells, usable for lists etc.
  - alloc, refcount, free, free-list, cell-pairs-page, cell-pairs-page-list
- cell-array :: array of cells, need special incremental gc on free
  - alloc, refcount, inc-free, inc-free-list, m1px-page, m1px-page-list
- native-array :: array of native bytes (e.g. for strings)
  - alloc, refcount, free, free-list, m1px-page, m1px-page-list
- call-frame :: frame with data to restore upon return
- cell-stack :: a stack of cells (split over two pages)
  - eval-stack :: stack used for evaluation
    - pop->rt :: pop from eval stack into rt (discard previous rt)
    - push<-rt :: push rt onto eval stack (effectively a dub)
    - write->rt :: write tos of eval stack into rt
    - write<-rt :: write rt into tos of eval stack

- Rx :: register
  - refcount-dec/inc :: refcount slot pointed to by register
  - clear :: mark as empty
** memory allocation/deallocation
*** free-lists
**** cell-array free list (for reusage)
- one per m1 profile => free list holds arrays blocking a slot of a certain m1 profile page
root -> [tag-byte : len n]
        [cell0]
        [cell1]
        ...
        [cell n-1]
         \_...
- the last cell points to the next cell-array
- enqueueing this array to the free list, the last cell must be recount--
- all but the last cell must be refcount-- before further reuse
- once cell n-1 is recount--, n = n-1, making n-2 the next last cell
- once all cells were refcount--, the whole array can be freed
**** cell free list (for reusage)
root -> [cell]
         \_...
**** cell-pair free list (for reusage)
root -> [car][cdr]
         \_ [car][cdr]
             \_...
- car cell is used to connect the cell-pairs
- cdr cell needs to be refcount-- before reuse
*** allocation
**** cell
- if free-list nil
     allocate new cell <- IDEA: try freeing slots in cell-array free-lists (there might be cells that can be reused)
     reuse head of free list
- reuse head of free list
  - remember head
  - set head of free list to cdr of free list
  - return old head
**** cell-pair
- if free-list nil
     allocate new cell-pair <- IDEA: try freeing slots in cell-array free-lists (there might be cell-pairs that can be reused)
     reuse head of free list
- reuse head of free list
  - remember head
  - refcount-- on cdr cell of head (single subroutine jump, no recursion)
  - new head = old heads car cell
  - return remembered head
**** cell-array
- if free-list nil
     allocate new cell-array
     free the array at the head of the list <- this might change due to the tail call
- free the array at the head of the list
  - reduce num (if num dropped to 0, the array can be reused)
  - remember now last cell
  - copy previous last cell into now last cell
  - refcount-- remembered now last cell  <- tail call (just jump, no recursion)
**** native-array
*** deallocation
any refcount-- on a value cell will just return (and do nothing), ending a chain of refcount-- calls
only if refcount drops to zero a free is done, else refcount returns
**** refcount-- cell-ptr (drops to 0)
- enqueue cell into free list
  - put old root of free list into this
  - set root of free list to this cell
**** refcount-- cell-pair-ptr (drops to 0)
- remember car cell (since it is overwritten in next step and used for refcount-- later on)
- enqueue cell-pair into free list
  - put old root of free list into car of this
  - set root of free list to this cell-pair
- refcount-- car cell <- tail-call (just jump, no recursion)
**** refcount-- cell-array (drops to 0)
- remember last cell of the array (since it is overwritten in next step and used for refcount-- later on)
- enqueue cell-array into free list
  - put old root into last cell of array
  - set root of free list to this cell-array
- refcount-- last cell of the array
**** refcount-- native-array (drops to 0)
- reclaim space (native array may not hold further references)
*** behavior
- overarching idea: make deallocation cheap, delay work to the time, allocation is done
- reuse of cell is of constant time, since the head of the free list can be used (directly) or a new cell is allocated, which is both O(1)
- reuse of cell-pair can be O(n) in worst case, if the cdr cell of the head (which needs to be refcount--) points to a tree of n cell-pairs,
  where each car points to another cell-pair that needs to be refcount-- before enqueued into the free-list.  it is more likely to be must
  faster since this worst case is of rather hypothetical nature.
  IDEA: this time can be reduced by incrementally refcount-- cdr cells of the free list (e.g. during allocation of cells or cell-pairs).
- reuse of cell-arrays could be very expensive if the array contains pointers to cell-arrays up to the max memory allocated thus
  IDEA: this time can be reduced by incrementally refcount-- cells of the array (e.g. during allocation of cells or cell-pairs).
*** musings
**** bst with value implemented with structure/array or cell-pairs
***** btree with array, fits into profile 5 (uses 9 bytes)
[table-header, len=3]
[left cell-ptr]
[right cell-ptr]
[value cell-ptr|cell]
***** btree with cell-pairs (uses 8 bytes for the cell pairs)
      o      cell-pair
     / \
   val  o    cell-pair
       / \
      L   R
***** red-black tree needs additional flag (for color)
- in arrays this could be put into higher bits of the length byte (since not all bits are used)
  -or- use the 9th byte of the structure as an auxiliary byte that is always available
- in cell-pair implementation L and R lower two bits can be used <- complicates a lot, don't!
  (since they must be '01' to identify them as cell-pair-ptr)
***** red/black btree with cell-pairs
****** red/black detection needs more code, search l/r search needs more code, no more memory is needed
(val may not be a cell-pair-ptr)

** naming conventions
ZP_ <- on zero page
functions have a verb (what they do, e.g. ALLOC​_PAGE​_TO​_A)
functions define main return register
register available are A, X, Y (as cpu registers), and vm registers RT RA
parameters for functions are passed through registers A/X/Y or use vm resources like the registers, stack, call-frame stack etc.
each function defines which cpu resources and/or vm resources are used during execution (including transitively called functions)
=> only the most basic functions don't use all cpu resources

- list = pair of cells (car + cdr=ptr to next cell-pair), car=0 => empty-list or nil
  e.g. list of bytes =
  (1 . o)->(2 . o)->(ptr0 . x)  ;; o)-> = cdr pointer, ptr0 = a pointer to cell 0 which is encoded into hex 0001
- list of pairs = (car=ptr to cell-pair of which car=key, cdr=value, + cdr=ptr to next pair)
- e.g. list of pairs, byte->string
  (o . o)->(o . o)->(ptr0 . x)
   |        |
   |        +->(5 . o)-> {header: string, length: 7, values: "at five"}
   +-->(2 . o)-> {header: string, length: 6, values: "at two" }

** continuations
** vm registers and runtime behavior
call, tail-call, variable resolution, continuations, closures, macros?
- (later) use cpu registers for parameters (quickest)
- (later) use zero page for parameters (quick)
- use stack for parameters (slow)
- tail call should be as simple as test + branch instruction
- macros should already be resolved (no vm instructions for that, for now)
- use flattened closures to allow O(1) access to live locals and globals
** vm instructions
- use single byte for vm instruction
- use minimal length for common (short) instructions (e.g. lists with 0-3 elements)
- allow larger lengths for uncommon (long) instructions (e.g. lists with 1000 elements)
- idea
  - define vm instructions
  - optimize for size and speed of decoding later
  - keep optimizing strategies in mind
    - encode (small) values into opcode
    - use prefix byte for long commands (long running and seldom used)
    - how can table jumps be used
    - how can bits in the opcode be used for common actions (bit = micro op)
